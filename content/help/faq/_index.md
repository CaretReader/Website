### iCloud Sync
#### Why isn't my library always being synced across devices?
iCloud Sync is still somewhat buggy at the moment and it's hit or miss if the syncing actually works. Consider toggling it off and on again.

Enable badges by navigating to Settings and check the **Unread Chapter Badges** section under the Library section.

### Browse
#### Why can't I see some profiles?
- By default, only multi-language profiles and profiles in your [Preferred Languages list](https://osxdaily.com/2021/07/01/set-preferred-language-change-region-iphone-ipad/#:~:text=Head%20over%20to%20%E2%80%9CSettings%E2%80%9D%20from,default%20language%20for%20your%20iPhone.) are shown. Enable more languages by navigating to Browse, selecting the globe icon on the top right, and select the languages you want.

### Reader
#### Why aren't my chapters being marked as read?
- You might not have reached the last page.
- You may have **Incognito Mode** enabled. Navigate to Settings and disable **Incognito Mode** under the General section.

### User Interface
