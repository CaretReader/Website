## Installing a profile

Once Caret Reader has been installed, you will need to use a profile in order to add content to your library.

Profiles are distributed in .aix packages that can be installed by opening them inside Caret Reader. Alternatively, Profile lists can be added in the settings page which allow installation directly from the Browse tab.

To find public profile lists, we recommend checking the [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/CaretReader).

## Adding manga to your library

Once have a profile installed, you can find and add manga to your library.

Start by opening your desired profile in the **Browse** tab. If the profile supports listings, you can sort the manga list by using the listing dropdown menu. In addition, there will be a search bar at the top if the profile supports searching by title.

When you find your desired manga, open it and tap on the bookmark icon. Alternatively, you can long press on the manga and select **Add to Library**. Once added to your library, the manga should appear in the **Library** tab.
